          <p>The Independent Transportation Network® (ITN), is the first and only national nonprofit transportation system for America's aging population.</p>

          <p>Our ITN model creates an efficient and financially sustainable solution to the transportation needs of seniors and visually challenged people. As ITN Members, older people maintain their independence and their dignity. </p>
          
          <p>They:
            <ul>
              <li>continue to be part of the economic and social health of their communities</li>
              <li>feel empowered</li>
              <li>stay connected to family, friends and community</li>

          <div class="answer wow fadeInRight" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="1s">
            <p>ITN<em>{{affiliate}}</em> understands that older people want to do much more than go to the doctor or the grocery store. For this reason, the service may be used for any purpose, without restriction, in the ITN<em>{{affiliate}}</em> service area. For example, ITN<em>{{affiliate}}</em> members often use the service to attend religious services, to get their hair done, to shop at the mall, and to visit loved ones in hospitals and nursing homes.</p>

            <p>Independent Transportation Network ® (ITN) volunteer drivers store transportation credits for their volunteer efforts. These credits may be used to plan for their own future transit needs or they may use these credits to help pay for rides for members of their family or for low income seniors through the Road Scholarship Program™.

            <p>Automobiles depreciate in value and when older people have vehicles they can no longer drive, the ITN CarTrade™ program helps them convert this depreciating capital asset into a fund to pay for their rides. In a way, CarTrade™ allows people to continue to benefit from their automobiles. Participation in CarTrade™ is a benefit of ITN membership, and there is no charge.</p>

          <div class="answer wow fadeInRight" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="1s">
            <p>Community organizations such as churches, assisted living facilities, and health care providers may contract with ITN to provide transportation services for their members. Once a month, ITN sends a statement to the organization to pay for the rides that the members take. This is a way for community organizations to supplement the transportation services they already provide. Community organizations that participate in Ride Services also help to support the ITN affiliate organization.</p>

          <div class="answer wow fadeInRight" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="1s">

          <div class="answer wow fadeInRight" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="1s">
            <p>The Personal Transportation Account™ is one of the core business innovations of the ITN system because it allows an ITN member to store transportation assets in various forms - either as a credit or as cash. Credits may be earned as a volunteer driver, by trading a car for rides through the CarTrade™ program, as a birthday credit, or as a referral credit. Cash may come from pre-payment, gift certificates, co-payments from participating merchants and healthcare providers, or from Ride Services accounts. ITN is a cashless system. Seniors who ride receive a statement once a month detailing the rides they have taken. Volunteer drivers also have personal transportation accounts to store their credits and receive statements detailing their accumulated balances.</p>

          <div class="qa" id="public-funds">
          <div class="question wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-duration="1s">Why does ITN avoid using public funds for operating expenses?</div>
          <div class="answer wow fadeInRight" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="1s">
            <p>ITN affiliate communities may use up to 50 percent public funds in the first 7 years of service. Because ITN does not want to compete with public transportation for scarce tax payer dollars, we seek to supplement public transportation by working directly with seniors, their families, and their communities to access private resources.</p>

          <div class="answer wow fadeInRight" data-wow-duration="1s" data-wow-delay="1s">
            <p>ITN<em>Country</em> is based on the ITN model, where transportation is provided by private automobiles 24 hours a day, for any purpose, through a combination of paid and volunteer drivers. Riders become members by opening Personal Transportation Accounts, which hold ride credits that can be earned in several ways—by driving, by trading in cars or by purchasing. Our innovative programs allow volunteer drivers to earn credits for their own future transportation needs, or people can trade cars they no longer drive to pay for rides. ITN is full of creative ways to increase the resources available to pay for transportation, and all of them are included in ITNCountry.</p>
