              <h2>What We Do</h2>
              <p>At ITN<em>America</em> we develop community-based transportation solutions designed to address the challenge of senior mobility. But that's only a small part of what we do. Our transportation programs are the action phase of our work, solutions developed following exhaustive research and examination of transportation policy nationwide. Our model is cyclical: We started more than two decades ago studying senior mobility, the challenges facing older people, their families and their communities. That led us to examine policy and the levers that influence how communities approach transportation across America. These two independent spheres fed the development of our network, affiliate model and the programs that have grown from it.</p>

              <p>And the research continues. Today we evaluate our own efforts, as well as the efforts of our partners and others, to find what solutions within the senior transportation services sphere truly work. And we examine policy to understand what combination of incentives offer the prospect of lifelong mobility, and what policies throw up barriers to sustainable solutions.</p>

              <p>This multi-pronged approach makes ITN<em>America</em> unique: Research feeds policy feeds programs. We live with everything under one roof, an organization without walls. Innovations can be developed, implemented and evaluated seamlessly, without barriers or hurdles. Nowhere else is senior transportation research, policy and programming approached so coherently, so comprehensively.</p>

            <p>With 13 affiliates in 12 states, ITN<em>America</em> supports sustainable, community-based transportation for seniors and people with visual impairments. But we aren’t yet everywhere, so to ensure older people in communities across America have access to quality transportation options we developed our Trusted Transportation Partners program. Trusted Transportation Partners, or TTPs, offer the highest level of transportation service, the sort of service we expect from our own affiliates, in non-ITN communities. It’s a way to take the guesswork out of deciding on your senior transportation selection—a TTP is an independent organization that has earned the ITN seal of excellence. We support them, because they support you.</p>

              <h3>Road Scholarship</h3>
              <p>The ITN Road Scholarship program helps low income seniors access rides regardless of ability to pay. Many ITN Volunteer drivers do not need to use all of the transportation credits they earn as they drive others. By contributing their excess credits to the Road Scholarship program, they actually give twice: once for the ride they give, and again with the scholarship they fund.</p>
              <p>A Community Road Scholarship is the same kind of program, only it is set up by a town, a church, or a service organization. When their members volunteer as ITN drivers, they can contribute their transportation credits into an account for their own residents or members to distribute credits to those in need. It is a way to ensure everyone can afford to live a full life even after they leave the driver’s seat.</p>

        <h4>ITN<em>America</em> is research-driven, and research begins with good information. To this end, ITN<em>America</em> has built and maintains three of the best senior transportation databases in the country: ITNRides, Rides in Sight, and the 50 State Policy Project. We conduct our own original research, and we have worked with universities, the Centers for Disease Control, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Federal Transit Administration, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Transportation Research Board (National Academies of Science) and numerous private philanthropies. Our theoretical knowledge is further informed with decades of on-the-ground experience working in the field serving older people. Our expertise has grown alongside our network, starting with service to one small community and expanding to cover every corner of the U.S. If you are looking for a place to access information on senior transportation nationwide, ITN<em>America</em> is where to begin.</h4>
