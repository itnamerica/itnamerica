          <p>As we close 2018, the year the ITN network surpassed one million rides for older and visually impaired adults nationwide, our eyes turn to the horizon. Twenty years ago in 1998, I wrote an article for “Aging Today,” titled Transportation Solutions on the Horizon, so it seems I’ve been looking toward that line where tomorrow meets today for some time. Re-reading that old article, I’m struck by the accuracy of my description of the future. In my imagined system, “…consumers share rides in rapidly dispatched automobiles that pick people up at their doors and take them where they need to go.”</p>

      <p> Fares are collected through credit cards and computers in cars use geographic information systems with electronic maps. Now we call this a smart phone. I even predicted the competition between transportation network companies like Uber and Lyft, describing it as “a price war, with providers competing for a piece of the lucrative senior transit market.” </p>

      <p>As I look to the horizon in 2018, what do I see now, and how is ITNAmerica creating that future for older people, their families and their communities? The answer is technology, research and practice; not technology for its own sake, but for the efficiency it can bring and the social obstacles it can resolve; not research for its own sake, but for the knowledge it can achieve and the good that knowledge can do in practice.</p>
      
      <p>We are determined to transition our ITNRides software to Salesforce, one of the world’s most robust platforms for non-profits. With generously donated routing algorithms from Esri (Environmental Systems Research Institute), we will have the best possible technology to support our affiliates and our new ITNCountry communities.</p>

        <div class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-7">
          <p>This future, however, is still on the horizon. We are working diligently to piece together the funding necessary to make this monumental leap. This transition will enable us to support hundreds of small volunteer transportation programs across rural America and connect them into a strong, proven, supported system. ITNCountry, the next iteration of ITN, will allow communities to customize ITNRides to their needs, but with the peace of mind of a robust platform and the benefits of a national support system.</p>

      <p>But that’s not all. We continue to work with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to explore research opportunities with the Highway Loss Data Institute at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, and to examine more than two decades of ITN’s volunteer data with the University of New England’s Center for Excellence in Aging & Health.</p>
      
      <p>Volunteerism and social capital will play a critical role in meeting the needs of older people and others in need of transportation services as we build a nonprofit platform for community based transportation networks. Technology unleashes these possibilities, and they are the future, the next horizon. ITNAmerica will be there. We invite you to join us.</p>
