          <p>As we close 2018, the year the ITN network surpassed one million rides for older and visually impaired adults nationwide, our eyes turn to the horizon. Twenty years ago in 1998, I wrote an article for “Aging Today,” titled Transportation Solutions on the Horizon, so it seems I’ve been looking toward that line where tomorrow meets today for some time. Re-reading that old article, I’m struck by the accuracy of my description of the future. In my imagined system, “…consumers share rides in rapidly dispatched automobiles that pick people up at their doors and take them where they need to go.”</p>

      <p> Fares are collected through credit cards and computers in cars use geographic information systems with electronic maps. Now we call this a smart phone. I even predicted the competition between transportation network companies like Uber and Lyft, describing it as “a price war, with providers competing for a piece of the lucrative senior transit market.” </p>

      <p>As I look to the horizon in 2018, what do I see now, and how is ITN<em>America</em> creating that future for older people, their families and their communities? The answer is technology, research and practice; not technology for its own sake, but for the efficiency it can bring and the social obstacles it can resolve; not research for its own sake, but for the knowledge it can achieve and the good that knowledge can do in practice.</p>

      <p>We are determined to transition our ITNRides software to Salesforce, one of the world’s most robust platforms for non-profits. With generously donated routing algorithms from Esri (Environmental Systems Research Institute), we will have the best possible technology to support our affiliates and our new ITNCountry communities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-7">
          <p>This future, however, is still on the horizon. We are working diligently to piece together the funding necessary to make this monumental leap. This transition will enable us to support hundreds of small volunteer transportation programs across rural America and connect them into a strong, proven, supported system. ITNCountry, the next iteration of ITN, will allow communities to customize ITNRides to their needs, but with the peace of mind of a robust platform and the benefits of a national support system.</p>

      <p>But that’s not all. We continue to work with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to explore research opportunities with the Highway Loss Data Institute at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, and to examine more than two decades of ITN’s volunteer data with the University of New England’s Center for Excellence in Aging & Health.</p>

      <p>Volunteerism and social capital will play a critical role in meeting the needs of older people and others in need of transportation services as we build a nonprofit platform for community based transportation networks. Technology unleashes these possibilities, and they are the future, the next horizon. ITN<em></em> will be there. We invite you to join us.</p>

          <p>Every fall ITN<em></em> hosts an Annual Retreat that connects Affiliates, board members, executive directors and organizational partners across the mobility sector. This past October’s Retreat was the best attended Retreat — and the best Retreat — I’ve had the pleasure of participating in. Sincere thanks go to the ITN<em></em> staff for their hard planning that made everything go smooth.</p>

      <p>All the speakers were excellent, and they even included an old friend: Jeff Arnold, president of Leading Associations, who facilitated a workshop on World-Class Nonprofit Leadership and Strategic Thinking. It was a thought-provoking conversation that was well received, and it broached the subject of an “elevator speech.”</p>

      <p>Many friends know I’m now retired. When people ask how I keep busy I tell them I’m involved with ITN<em></em>. That answer often elicits a blank stare. This is when an “elevator speech” comes to the rescue.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4" style="overflow:hidden">
          <img src="http://itnretreat.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Jeff-Arnold-2017.jpeg" style="height:300px;margin-top:20px"/>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-offset-1 col-md-7">
          <p>Jeff helped us understand what an ITN “elevator speech” should look like. Some folks panic when their boss’s boss’s boss steps into the elevator and says: “So, how’s it going? What have you been working on?” In 46 years with Liberty Mutual I learned I better have a coherent reply. This was basically the same thing, just about the organization I volunteer on the board of.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <ul class="elevator-list">So in that vein, at the October Retreat we came up with an “elevator speech” about ITN:
        <li>ITN serves a population that needs reliable and safe transportation</li>
        <li>persons who may no longer drive because their driving skills have diminished or those who may be visually impaired.</li>
        <li>Unlike ride-share services, ITN drivers provide arm-through-arm, door-through-door service.</li>
        <li>We offer rides for any reason – doctor visits, shopping, hairdresser appointments, bridge games, pretty much anything.</li>
        <li>ITN drivers are carefully vetted to assure they are safe and well qualified.</li>
        <li>ITN drivers can be volunteers or paid.</li>
        <li>ITN drivers are often retirees themselves building ride credits for their own future transportation needs.</li>
        <li>The ITN model includes opportunities for individuals who choose to no longer drive to donate their vehicle(s) for future rides.</li>
        <li>ITN drivers and clients often form a real friendship – the socialization that many clients want when they might otherwise become homebound.</li>
        <li>No money changes hands over the course of the ride.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>No doubt there are other ways to explain ITN, but the above serves as a foundation for that “elevator speech” every person involved in ITN needs. It was a vital exercise, one the Retreat attendees thoroughly enjoyed, as did I. The next time I see that blank stare I’ll know exactly what to say.</p>

        <p>2018 Milestones</p>
        <hr class="red-hr" width="20%" />

        <p>2018 was a tremendous year for ITN. In May the ITN ride count ceased to tick along at six digits, surpassing 1 million rides for the first time. It was the culmination of years of work providing arm-through-arm, door-through-door service in communities across the country. Our nationwide network has helped literally thousands of older people and visually impaired people live full, mobile lives.</p>

        <p class="mt-25">In recognition of this achievement, this spring U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King introduced and the Senate passed Senate Resolution 491, “Recognizing the Independent Transportation Network of America on the occasion of providing 1,000,000 rides to older and visually challenged people of the United States.” On the House side, Representatives Chellie Pingree and Bruce Poliquin introduced an identical resolution, House Resolution 851, to be read into the Congressional record. Both resolutions congratulate “the volunteers and staff of the Independent Transportation Network of America in communities across the United States for the 1,000,000 rides they have provided to older and visually challenged people, their families, and their communities.” The House and Senate recognized ITNAmerica for serving the common good by helping people remain in their own homes and communities after they can no longer drive safely, anticipating “many more millions of rides in the future.”</p>
